# -------------------------- XCom -----------------------------
# XCom - cross-communication, a feature that helps tasks to
# communicate between themselves. Cross-communication utilizes
# Python’s pickling functionality. Python’s pickle module is
# used to serialize a Python object’s structure into a
# character stream and to deserialize it back. Objects that
# can’t be pickled can’t be shared using xcom
