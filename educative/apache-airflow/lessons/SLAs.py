# SLA - service level agreements
# An SLA, or a Service Level Agreement, is an expectation
# for the maximum time a Task should be completed relative
# to the Dag Run start time. If a task takes longer than
# this to run, it is then visible in the “SLA Misses” part
# of the user interface, as well as going out in an email
# of all tasks that missed their SLA.
