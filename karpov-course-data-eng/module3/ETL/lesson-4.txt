 how to crate dag dynamically.
  all dags in DAG_FOLDER,
  dag in globals()

   - generate from json/yaml file,
   - generate from global variables/connections
   - statical generation many same dags

 Airflow best practice:
 - Idempotent,
 - Don't save pass in code (use connections),
 - Don't save temp file locally, (use s3, hdfs)
 - Delete unnecessary code (all logic in tasks)
 - Don't use airflow vars (use in jinja, env or inside tasks)
