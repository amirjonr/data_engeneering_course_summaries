What is ETL?
  - is the process of data migration from one storage to another.

When you have to use it?
  - when u have multiple services, but want to analyze it single storage.

 - Transform
 - Load
Example:

 Principles of creating pipeline:
  - clean code (PEP8)
  - simplicity (understandable)
  - uniformity (al dags are same)
  - execution time of pipeline (if daily process takes more than 1 day)
  - work only with replica (not with master)
  - optimize data collection (indexes, etc.)
  - less network traffic (select only necessary data)
  - partition
  - delete non-actual pipelines
  - idempotent


Be ready:
 - lack of integrity
 - problem with connection
 - unplanned changes
 - pipeline delay
